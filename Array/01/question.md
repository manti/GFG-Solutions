Search, insert and delete in an unsorted array

Search Operation:
	In an unsorted array, the search operation can be performed by linear traversal from the first element to the last element.

Insert Operation:
	In an unsorted array, the insert operation is faster as compared to sorted array because we donâ€™t have to care about the position at which the element is to be placed.

Delete Operation:
	In delete operation, the element to be deleted is searched using the linear search and then delete operation is performed followed by shifting the elements.

Time complexities:

Search: O(n)
Insert: O(1)
Delete: O(n)
